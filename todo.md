# Unsorted
//TODO reverse engineer the firefox extension for this app https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34006202 , it does a lot of the stuff I wanted to do and has a really slick ui. could use their ideas. ALSO reverse engineer the web page for the app, its super slick and would be a great way to navigate my nb instead of the shit nb server webpage it presents
//TODO consider using the layout from this app https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34006202 in designing an updates tracks app for veiwing playlists, creating them, searching, etc..
//TODO if if move to extension generated index (isntead of github pages) how can i ensure the same level of data persistence like hosting it on github would provide?
    //whatever I do for tracks I could do for external sites, store it as a similar data structure somewhere
//TODO fix some links not working inside the catalog index.html, requesting to be viewed in youtube (e.g. macroblank) but doesnt happen when played from github pages site
//TODO icon isnt showin up for the catalog index.html tab
//TODO add lines to track table to see corresponding play track button better
//TODO add a red live(()) option to the link like the live videos have 
//TODO Function that cleans up dead links? (yt-player does this I saw, wonder if reactplayer offers this kind of option? surely theres a url I can hit to check?)
//TODO function that cleans up duplicate links (or avoids adding it if its a duplicate)
//TODO function that alphabetises links (more so for radio.js)
//TODO add all external sites to a csv and load them through js instead

//TODO add seashells theme, nightmode theme, css theme from that open source github hosted blog website
//TODO allow app state to be stored as a url string (which someone has already done here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34312546)

//TODO function that adds tags and can filter based on tags 
//TODO function that lets me remove tracks from the list inside the index file (thats a powerful feature to add to a public page so maybe not)?

//TODO keyboard command shortcut https://github.com/darktrojan/openwith/blob/master/webextension/manifest.json

//todo see if i cna use this in my quest to make plugin easier to use (and not deal with the whole mozilla plugin access thing https://web.dev/new-patterns-for-amazing-apps/)

# High
- [ ] get extension working to easily save track urls in browser tab to disk
- [ ] drag and drop feature to import songs from file
- [ ] export feature to save songs added
- [ ] TODO filter duplicates out
- [ ] TODO strike out videos that cant be played
- [ ] TODO add videos to table
- [ ] easily creatable/saveable anonymous playlists 
    - (bookmarks?)



# Med
- [ ] get ReactPlayer to worl
- [ ] mini player in the extension to pause/play
- [ ] queue up tracks
- [ ] repeat/loop tracks
- [ ] create playlists
- [ ] add option to append new track straight to github repo file
- [ ] have add local options but also save those as a bundle to a external repo
- [ ] maybe make seperate files and then bundle them up together into a single file that can be dropped into any repo
- [ ] maybe some easy way to save your playlist to a url (or disk) for use by people easily with git? that way it can be saved as a bookmark!


# Low
- [ ] add filters and tags
- [ ] consider adding mongodb read/write 
    - [ ] maybe make playlists social like how youtube used to be, let people discover other music like a webring
    - [ ] could do meta analysis then and look at most used tags, most saved track, users that share the most in common with you, suggested songs???
- [ ] setup an autosync feature that doesnt save them through bookmarks 
    - dunno about this one, nb-bookmarks works well and would only need to be done if extended to store/retriece track urls outside github
